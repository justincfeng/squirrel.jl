# squirrel.jl

This is a curved spacetime relativistic location tool for use in relativistic positioning systems. It computes the intersection point of future pointing light cones from at least four distinct spacelike separated emission points in slightly curved spacetime geometries.

To get started, refer to the tutorials in the [documentation](https://justincfeng.github.io/squirrel.jl).
