## Introduction

Relativistic positioning refers to the concept of establishing spacetime
positions from proper time broadcasts emitted by a system of satellites.
Central to relativistic positioning is the relativistic location
location problem, which is the problem of finding the intersection of
future pointing light cones from a collection of at least four emission
points. `squirrel.jl` contains a collection of functions for the
relativistic location problem in slightly curved spacetime geometries.

## Short tutorial

### Setup

The `squirrel.jl` code was written for and tested in Julia 1.6; we
recommend Julia 1.6 or newer. To add the code, run the following command
in the pagkage manager for the Julia `REPL`:

    pkg> add https://github.com/justincfeng/squirrel.jl/

    Julia> using squirrel

### Positioning example



### Evaluation

Scripts are provided for evaluating the accuracy and performance of the
functions in `squirrel.jl`. To evaluate the
