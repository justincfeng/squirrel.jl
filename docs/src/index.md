## Introduction

Relativistic positioning refers to the concept of establishing spacetime
positions from proper time broadcasts emitted by a system of satellites.
Central to relativistic positioning is the relativistic location
location problem, which is the problem of finding the intersection of
future pointing light cones from a collection of at least four emission
points. `squirrel.jl` contains a collection of functions for the
relativistic location problem in slightly curved spacetime geometries.
